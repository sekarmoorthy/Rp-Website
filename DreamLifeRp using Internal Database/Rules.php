					<img src="Images/dis.gif" width="26" height="15" />  NO COP BAITING.  Do not purposefully try and get police attention on you by doing things you would not do with an officer near you. This includes, burning out in the middle of intersections, purposefully revving your motor at lights to bait a pull over/chase, purposely committing traffic violations in the vicinity of a police officer.
				</p>
				<p> </p>
				<p>
					<img src="Images/dis.gif" width="26" height="15" />  No RDM/VDM. RDM (Random death match): killing/attempting to kill without intent and roleplay. VDM (Vehicle death match): using a vehicle to kill/attempt to kill without intent or roleplay. KEEP IN MIND THAT WE ARE A ROLEPLAY SERVER. Deadly action needs to be roleplayed. Killing on site is not allowed as it could be seen as a form of RDM.

					<img src="Images/dis.gif" width="26" height="15" />  Meta-gaming is not allowed. Meta-gaming: the act of using out-of-character/external information for in-game situations. This includes stream sniping, 3rd party VOIP applications, and etc.
				</p>
				<p> </p>
				<p>
					<img src="Images/dis.gif" width="26" height="15" />  Power-gaming is not allowed. Power-gaming: using mechanics or roleplaying mechanics that do not exist.
				</p>
				<p> </p>
				<p>
					<img src="Images/dis.gif" width="26" height="15" />  Follow FearRP. FearRP: fearing for your life. For example, if you are alone in an alleyway and 4 gang members hold you at gunpoint and you cannot escape without dying, you must follow FearRP. The average person would follow their demands as they are helpless in a situation of such, you wouldn't just walk away.
				</p>
				<p> </p>
				<p>
					<img src="Images/dis.gif" width="26" height="15" />  Do not FailRP. Due to the mechanics of GTA V, things that are completely unrealistic and down right impossible to do are easily done while in game. Think before you do, your actions should be thought out before you act. For example, driving off an overpass and dropping 20+ feet while in your vehicle, flipping the vehicle multiple times, then proceeding to continue driving off while being pursued by police will not be tolerated. Realistic actions and responses.

					<img src="Images/dis.gif" width="26" height="15" />  /ooc is to be used for help only. Do not engage in conversation over ooc. Failure to follow this will result in warnings, kicks and following up, bans.
